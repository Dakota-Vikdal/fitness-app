App is full-stack, built out with Flask, React, and SQLAlchemy.

App will allow users to perform full CRUD actions on food items in order to track their macros and thus caloric intake.

App will eventually expand to include exercise page that will allow users to create workout routines and journal about 
a given workout, how it felt, issues they ran into, weight used, etc.

App may go further and become a small social media platform in which users can post about their diet, workout, how they're
feeling on that day, if they hit a recent PR, what's been difficult about dieting, and so on.

Let the shenanigans begin.
